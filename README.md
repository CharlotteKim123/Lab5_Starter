1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

  I would not because you would need to see how each component of the message interact with each other, which unit testing does not do.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

   Yes, I would because the length is made up of individual, isolated character components, so unit testing would work.
